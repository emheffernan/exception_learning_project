# exception_learning_project

In a series of behavioral and computational modelling experiments, I explored how delaying the introduction of exceptions in rule-plus-exception categorization task impacted learning outcomes. 

This work was published in Scientific Reports – you can read the article [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00864-9). 

I also presented my findings at the Cognitive Science Society's 2021 Annual Meeting – [this](https://utoronto-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/emily_heffernan_mail_utoronto_ca/EXVMJROUsjBAqyzNRZ9C_gQBCEkPEqQ_X6FYC6Ewaz4t8A?e=UlDlv0&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D) is a link to my recorded talk. 

In this repository, there is an R notebook (data_visualization.nb.html) that showcases some of the data visualizations I created for my publication (with collaboration from Drs. Mike Mack and Meg Schlichting).
